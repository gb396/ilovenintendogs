    and hunting instincts, they were originally bred for tracking. Beagles' compact size, combined with their friendly

    Finally, **Bulldogs** are adored for their distinctive wrinkled faces and lovable personalities. Despite their
    somewhat intimidating appearance, they are gentle and affectionate dogs that form strong bonds with their families.
    Bulldogs are known for their laid-back attitude and adaptability, making them ideal for those who enjoy a more
    relaxed lifestyle. Their loyalty and sweet nature make them one of the most endearing breeds.
